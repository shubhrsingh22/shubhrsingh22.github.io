I am currently a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence and Music at [Queen Mary University of London's Centre for Digital Music](https://www.c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) and also an enrichment student at [The Alan Turing Institute,UK](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). My research centers on developing  graph neural network models to enhance the recognition of environmental sounds and musical elements. I have a particular interest in constructing models that treat sounds as graphs, connecting various regions across frequency and time to create a detailed representation of the audio object. I am jointly supervised by [Dr Emmanouil Benetos](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~emmanouilb/), [Dr Huy Phan](https://pquochuy.github.io/) and [Dr Dan Stowell](http://mcld.co.uk/research/) and am very grateful to be funded by the [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence and Music](https://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk/).

In addition to my research, I am deeply committed to the study of Indian classical music, learning under the esteemed guidance of [Ustad Dharambir Singh](http://www.dharambir.com/about-2-2/) and [Vidushi Roopa Panesar](http://roopapanesarmusic.com/).
